You know those moments that stick with you sometimes?  They become part of a lifetime reel in your head.

Oddly, the very first person I met in college was a graduating engineer on his way out.  I'd had a good breakfast that morning and heard myself ask for advice about what engineering was like, what would I learn over the next four years and, especially, what to watch out for.  Without missing a beat he admitted he'd forgotten just about everything they taught him ... except for this one thing.

"What was it?!", I asked, expecting sarcasm. 

He must have had his breakfast too because he came back with something I haven't forgotten since.

"Studying mechanical engineering changed the way I think." he told me. "I know I'll never again worry about whether I'm smart enough.  No matter what the problem, I only have to learn just enough to break it down into some reasonable pieces. Then I go to work solving the hardest parts first and, once I'm done, put them all back together again.  That's pretty much all you ever need, right?"

At the time I blew it off because this fool was still in his PJs but, somewhere along the way, I'm not exactly sure when, I started to understand what he meant.
