This is how I maintain my personal site, available here: http://sherifabushadi.com

The setup includes [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, [Bulma CSS](http://bulma.io/) for making it look good and [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/) for deployment.

Since I forget sometimes because I have the memory of a goldfish:

- `hugo server` hot reloads on `localhost:1313` to edit
- `deploy.sh` deploys the site

Everything should be this easy
