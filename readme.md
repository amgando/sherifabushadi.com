This is how I maintain my personal site, available here: http://sherifabushadi.com

The setup includes [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, [Bulma CSS](http://bulma.io/) for making it look good and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment.

Since I forget sometimes because I have the memory of a goldfish:

- `hugo server` hot reloads on `localhost:1313` to edit
- pushing to `master` deploys the site via Netlify commit hooks

Everything should be this easy
